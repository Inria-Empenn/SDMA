# Contents overview

<Summarise what's in this repository>

## Reproducing figures and tables

<Instructions on how to use summary/derived data in the `results` directory to create figures and tables>

Narps and HCP data first must be downloaded and store in data/NARPS and data/HCP

### Table 1

### Fig. 1
To obtain all figures stored in "figures/NARPS/spatial_homogeneity", run the script "intersectional_mask.py" and then the script "spatial_homogeneity_in_NARPS.py"



### Fig. 2

## Reproducing full analysis

<Instructions on how to (1) obtain raw data; (2) process it to create summary/derived data in the `results`>

<Specify precise steps, including any datasets that need to be downloaded and path variables that need to be set>
